AugmintToken -> ExchangeContract : placeSellOrder\n(augmintToken, userAddress, amount)

note over AugmintToken
    transferFromNoFee() is restricted to trusted Exchanges
    Exchange needs to call standard transferFrom when
    trading non-Augmint ERC20 tokens
end note

ExchangeContract -> ExchangeContract : save order
note left
    we could just queue new orders to have constant gas
    cost for place order and a match could add orders
    to the orderbook in batch.
end note
== taker order  ==
Taker -> ExchangeContract : placeBuyOrder\n(AugmintToken, price, {ethValue})
ExchangeContract -> ExchangeContract : save order
note over ExchangeContract, Taker
    shall we have an additional placeAndMatchBuyOrder()
    which would do match immediately?
end note
== matching  ==
Taker -> ExchangeContract : matchMultiple(tokenContracts[])
note left
    matchMultiple() and match() is not restricted
    Caller can be a 3rd party service and will be rewarded with Eth
end note
loop as many times as fits to gas provided to tx call
    ExchangeContract -> ExchangeContract : match(tokenContract)
    ExchangeContract -> ExchangeContract : fill/partially fill order
    ExchangeContract -> Seller : seller.send( ethValue - tradeFee )

 Q: how do we decide if transfer or transferNoFee
 should be called on ERC20Token?
end note
