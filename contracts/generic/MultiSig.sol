/* Abstract multisig contract to allow multi approval execution of atomic contracts scripts
        e.g. migrations or settings.
    * Script added by signing a script address by a signer  (NEW state)
    * Script goes to ALLOWED state once a quorom of signers sign it (quorom fx is defined in each derived contracts)
    * Script can be signed even in APPROVED state
    * APPROVED scripts can be executed only once.
        - if script succeeds then state set to DONE
        - If script runs out of gas or reverts then script state set to FAILEd and not allowed to run again
          (To avoid leaving "behind" scripts which fail in a given state but eventually execute in the future)
    * Scripts can be cancelled by an other multisig script approved and calling cancelScript()
    * Adding/removing signers is only via multisig approved scripts using addSigners / removeSigners fxs
