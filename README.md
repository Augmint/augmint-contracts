# Augmint - Stable Digital Tokens - Solidity Contracts

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Augmint/augmint-contracts.svg?branch=staging)](https://travis-ci.org/Augmint/augmint-contracts) [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/Augmint/augmint-contracts.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Decentralised stable cryptocurrency on Ethereum

## Concept

Augmint provides digital tokens, value of each token pegged to a fiat currency.

The first Augmint token will be A-EUR (Augmint Crypto Euro), pegged to EUR.

The value of 1 A-EUR is always closely around 1 EUR.

Augmint tokens are cryptocurrency tokens with all the benefits of cryptocurrencies: stored securely in a decentralised manner and instantly transferable worldwide.

## Solidity Contracts

* [Restricted.sol](./contracts/generic/Owned.sol)  
   Stores which address can access which function call.
* [ERC20.sol](./contracts/generic/ERC20.sol)  
  Standard [ERC20](https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard) token interface.
* [SystemAccount.sol](./contracts/generic/ERC20.sol)
  Generic contract to maintain balances of Augmint system accounts
* [AugmintReserves](./contracts/AugmintReserves.sol)
    * Holds Augmint's ETH and token reserves
* [InterestEarnedAccount](./contracts/InterestEarnedAccount.sol)
    * Holds interest from lending (token) - only repaid loans, ie. already "earned"
    * Provides interest for Locks
* [FeeAccount.sol](./contracts/FeeAccount.sol)
    * holds all fees (ETH & Token)
    * calculates fees (not implemented yet, to be split out from AugmintToken & Exchange & LoanManager)
* [AugmintToken.sol](./contracts/generic/AugmintToken.sol)  
  Base contract for all Augmint tokens.
    * ERC20 standard functions
    * maintains account token balances
    * Generic `transferAndNotify` "convenience" function
    * allow MonetarySupervisor to issue tokens on loan disbursement and for reserve
    * allows accounts to burn their tokens (used by repay loan and burn from reserves via MonetarySupervisor contract)
* [MonetarySupervisor.sol](./contracts/MonetarySupervisor.sol)
    * maintains system wide KPIs (eg totalLockAmount, totalLoanAmount)
    * holds system wide parameters/limits
    * enforces system wide limits
    * issue to & from reserve functions
* [TokenAEur.sol](./contracts/TokenAEur.sol)
    * First AugmintToken contract instance, pegged for pegged to EUR (A-EUR aka Augmint Crypto Euro aka Aâ‚¬ )
    * Sets standard token parameters (name, symbol, decimals, peggedSymbol etc.)
* [Rates.sol](./contracts/Rates.sol)  
  A contract to return fiat/ETH exchange rates
* [Exchange.sol](./contracts/Exchange.sol)  
  A-EUR / ETH exchange contract. Sell or buy A-EUR for ETH on A-EUR/ETH market rates.
* [LoanManager.sol](./contracts/LoanManager.sol)
    * Loan products and their parameters
    * Maintains all loans: new loans, repayment, collection
* [Locker.sol](./contracts/Lock.sol)
    * Lock products and parameters
    * Token fund locking and releasing
